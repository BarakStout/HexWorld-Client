## How to Play
You will command your **Empire** through *Actions*. There are six *Categories*, each with two *Actions*.  
Every three seconds you may click one *Action* to do. The effects of the *Action* take place after three seconds.   
(Hint: Clicking the *Action's* button will type a code into the chat. Press ENTER to activate the *Action*.)  
Each *Category* also has an associated Resource with a three-character shortening that is sometimes used.  
Resources are gained and spent to grow your **Empire**.

## Expanding
To grow your **Empire**, you'll upgrade a variety of aspects.  

* Conquering <font color="white"><b> Territory =T=</b></font> lets you spend more resources at once.
* Conquering <font color="white"><b> Territory =T=</b></font> also gives you a bonus every power of 10 territory, e.g. 1 =T= equals x1, 10 =T= equals x2, 100 =T= equals x3, et c.  
* Leveling up your *Categories* using Discover increases gains per *Action*.  
* Increasing max storage using Build allows you to hold more Resources.  

The only way to survive in the HexWorld will be to get as strong as possible as quickly as possible.  
Be prepared for anything. If you try and specialize on one thing, you'll be destroyed unless you have help.  
If you <font color="white"><b> Territory =T=</b></font> reaches zero, your **Empire** will fall. You will be allowed one "last words" chat message, then die.  
You will be destroyed a lot. Remember allies are better than enemies and team up to survive.  
Trading with other **Empires** will help everyone. Use /send to transfer resources to another **Empire**. The full command list can be seen by typing /help.
    Good luck!
