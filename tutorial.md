# HexWorld Tutorial
## What is HexWorld?
HexWorld is a game about building a mighty Empire alongside other real players with similar goals.
Conquer Territory from the world, upgrade, and grow to become the strongest Empire in the game.
There is limited land in this world. Take it while you can, or destroy the weak to thieve theirs.
You can be a warmonger, diplomat, traitor, defender, mercenary, hero: The HexWorld is open to anything.

## How to Play
You will command your Empire through Actions. There are six Categories, each with two Actions.  
Every three seconds you may select one Action to do. The effects of the Action take place after three seconds.   
(Hint: Clicking the Action's button will type a code into the chat. Press ENTER to activate the action.)  
Each Category also has an associated Resource with a three-character shortening that is sometimes used.  
Resources are gained and spent to grow your Empire.  
See the Categories, Actions, and Resources below.

## Expanding
To grow your Empire, you'll upgrade a variety of aspects.  

* Conquering Territory =T= lets you spend more resources at once.
* Conquering Territory =T= also gives you a bonus every power of 10 territory, e.g. 1 =T= equals x1, 10 =T= equals x2, 100 =T= equals x3, et c.  
* Leveling up your Categories using Discover increases gains per Action.  
* Increasing max storage using Build allows you to hold more Resources.  

The only way to survive in the HexWorld will be to get as strong as possible as quickly as possible.  
Be prepared for anything. If you try and specialize on one thing, you'll be destroyed unless you have help.  
If you Territory =T= reaches zero, your Empire will fall. You will be allowed one "last words" chat message, then die.  
You will be destroyed a lot. Remember allies are better than enemies and team up to survive.  
Trading with other Empires will help everyone. Use /send to transfer resources to another Empire. The full command list can be seen by typing /help.
    Good luck!
